# Lean functions written with well-founded `while` loops

Lean's `while` (in `do` notation) is `partial`: the uploaded `while` functions
(`Tco.diagonalWhile`, `Tco.mc91While`, `Tco.AckWithoutStackButUsingCantorPairing.isqrt`, …) have
no termination proof and cannot be unfolded in proofs.  These are the same loops written with the
well-founded loop of `Core/While.lean` (the notation `wf_while`, or `WFLang.whileWF` with an
invariant): each one states its termination measure, and is captured by
`#lean_wf_func_to_term` as a `PCL` `while` statement (`Tests/While.lean`).

The uploaded `while` functions themselves are captured too, through `lean_while_to_wf` and the
unfolding law of Lean's `while`, `WFLang.loopLaw` (`Tests/LeanWhile.lean`).
