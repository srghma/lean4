# The theorems of the uploaded files

The proofs that accompanied the functions of the uploaded `Tco*.lean` files, about the Lean
functions in namespace `Tco` (`Functions.lean`).  They are kept here because the uploaded files
were removed; `Sources.lean` uses them to transfer the `PCL` agreement theorems to the
functions that `PCL` cannot capture directly (`ack2`, `hyperTCO`, `hyperWhile`).

Changes with respect to the uploaded files:
* `mc91Loop_eq`: the uploaded proof used `grind => instantiate only [mc91Loop, iter]`, whose
  syntax does not exist in this Lean version; it is now proved through `Function.iterate`
  (see the last item).
* `diagonalWhile_eq` (`diagonalWhile m n = diagonal m n`) is **not** included.  Its proof was
  written for a later Lean (`v4.34.0`) whose `mvcgen` has a specification for `while` loops.  In
  this project's Lean (`v4.28.0`) a `while` loop is `Lean.Loop.forIn`, defined through a private
  `partial` function, which is opaque to proofs, so the statement cannot be proved here.
  `Sources.lean` checks it on sample inputs instead (and does the same for the other
  `while`-loop functions).
* The two iteration helpers `iter` and `hyperLoop` are identified with Mathlib's
  `Function.iterate` (`f^[n]`, lemmas `iter_eq_iterate`, `hyperLoop_eq_iterate`), and the
  proofs of `hyperLoop_step` and `mc91Loop_eq` use Mathlib's iterate lemmas instead of
  unfolding the helpers.
